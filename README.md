MHCF: HF Control Flow for MassiveDL
======================

The MHCF aims to support Hugging Face's automatic management, plus:

* MHCF creates spaces for virtualization deployment and
    hosting of large deep learning models.

* MHCF allows using `config.toml` to automatically configure space
    templates, e.g., `title`, `emoji`, `colorFrom`, `colorTo`,
    `sdk`, and `app_port`.

* The MHCF runs a debuggable testing environment, providing a
    convenient rootless toolkit for remote access.
